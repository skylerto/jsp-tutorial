	<h3>What are JSPs</h3>
	<p>
		JavaServer Pages (JSPs) are essentially ways to embed Java into HTML webpages. 
		Much like PHP and Ruby's ERB. To deploy/run JSPs you need a compatable web server such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty. 
		JSPs are usually used as the view component and a Java server-side model-view-controller (MVC) architecture. If you're familiar with Java Servlets, JSPs are just a more elegant way of presenting Servlets. i.e. JSPs are compiled, at runtime, into servlets.
